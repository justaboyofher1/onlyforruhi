      <h1>Hey Ruhi,</h1>
      <p>
        If you are reading this, I've done what I've told you. I'm doing this — this is
        what I've been doing for a long time and I think it's worth it. Everything is
        worth it when it's with you. So this is just for the introduction. You will see a
        lot of things. So right here I just want to say — I love you and I’ve done it.
      </p>

          <h2>Our Story 💌</h2>
          <p>
            So we met on a random afternoon in October — on the 17th to be precise (even though I texted her a day before, she replied a day late... spoiler: this happens a lot 😭).
            I saw her in a group chat where I was famous for using the word “genuine” so often, they literally named me “genuine.” 
            I thought she was old based on her PFP (spoiler: it wasn’t even her 😭) and assumed she wouldn’t talk to me. But then she posted a reel — and I replied to it with:
            <br><br>
            “Genuine (The sexual tension between me and the gun is unbeatable).”
            <br><br>
            And the next day... SHE REPLIED. Her first message to me, and I quote:
            <br>
            <strong>“ek aur baar genuine likha toh gand maar dungi.”</strong>
            <br>
            (Translation: If you say ‘genuine’ one more time, I’ll f*ck you in the ass 😭)
            <br><br>
            Bold start? YES.
            <br><br>
            And that’s how it began. Fast forward — we talked night and day, non-stop. One time I replied late and she said, “So you can breathe but not reply?” I never replied late again 💀.
            <br><br>
            There’s more — she sent me a giant letter on my birthday. No one’s ever done that for me. It was so good, I still have it and I’ll keep it forever.
            Then she moved to Russia (yes — my girlfriend is a damn DOCTOR 🤯). 
            I moved to Italy.
            We fought. We laughed. We… well… jerked off. But we never left.
            <br><br>
            We were supposed to meet this year — but life had other plans. So I built this. For her. For us.
            <br><br>
            I may not be rich or brilliant like Ruhi is. But I can love her like a freak. Obsessively. Endlessly. With everything I’ve got.
            <br><br>
